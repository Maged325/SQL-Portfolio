# **Olympics Data**

## In this dataset, I practice writing SQL queries using PostgreSQL on a real dataset. The data is about the 120 years of Olympics history that I downloaded from Kaggle from the user rgriffin.

### You can view the 2 datasets I used, along with the SQL_Queries files :

1. [Datasets](https://github.com/Maged325/SQL-Portfolio/blob/main/Project_4/Datasets.rar) file.
3. Creating tables  [SQL_Tables](https://github.com/Maged325/SQL-Portfolio/blob/main/Project_4/SQL_Tables.sql) file.
4. Answering Questins [SQL_Queries](https://github.com/Maged325/SQL-Portfolio/blob/main/Project_4/SQL_Queries.sql) file.

### Creating Column Data Types for both Tables

### You can take this code and use it to import the data (athlete_events.csv)
