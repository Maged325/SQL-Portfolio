# **Olympics Data**

## In this dataset, I practice writing SQL queries using PostgreSQL on a real dataset. The data is about the 120 years of Olympics history that I downloaded from Kaggle from the user rgriffin.

### You can view the 2 datasets I used, along with the SQL_Queries files :

1. First dataset  athlete_events  file.
2. Second dataset   noc_regions   file.
3. Creating tables   SQL_Tables  file.
4. Answering Questins   SQL_Queries file.

### Creating Column Data Types for both Tables



### Data from "athlete_events" file. I load this data into a table named "OLYMPICS_HISTORY".




### Data from "noc_regions file". I load this data into a table named "OLYMPICS_HISTORY_NOC_REGIONS".
